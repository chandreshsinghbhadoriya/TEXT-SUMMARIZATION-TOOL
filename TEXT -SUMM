Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern society faster than ever. From medicine to manufacturing, AI applications
enhance efficiency and support decision-making. In medicine, deep learning systems help detect diseases earlier and more accurately.
Manufacturing industries employ AI-powered robots to automate repetitive tasks and monitor quality control. Additionally, tools like
ChatGPT and MidJourney are changing how humans engage with computers and create digital content. Despite the advantages, there are
concerns about AI‚Äôs impact on employment, data security, and ethics. Policymakers, engineers, and educators must collaborate to create
responsible frameworks for AI use. While the potential of AI is enormous, its growth must be managed with care to prevent unintended harm.
